# Summary of Online Retail Data Analysis

This analysis explores an online retail dataset to uncover key business insights through data cleaning, feature engineering, and visualization.

## Data Cleaning and Preparation

- **Missing Values:** Missing values in the 'Description' column were imputed by finding the most frequent description for each 'StockCode'.
- **Invalid Entries:** Rows with non-positive 'Quantity' or 'UnitPrice' were removed to ensure data quality.

### Feature Engineering

- A `TotalPrice` column was calculated by multiplying `Quantity` and `UnitPrice`.
- A `Month` column was extracted from the `InvoiceDate`.

## Chart Analysis and Insights

### Sales by Month

- **Chart Type:** Line plot with markers.
- **Observation:** The line plot shows the total sales amount for each month. There's a noticeable dip in sales in February and April, followed by stability from May to August. A significant upward trend begins in September and peaks in November, with a slight decrease in December.
- **Insight:** Sales exhibit strong seasonality, with the highest revenue generated in the last quarter of the year, likely driven by holiday shopping. This suggests that marketing and inventory management should be optimized for this period.

### Top 5 Countries by Sales

- **Chart Type:** Horizontal bar chart.
- **Observation:** The bar chart displays the percentage of total sales contributed by the top 5 countries. The United Kingdom accounts for an overwhelmingly large percentage of sales compared to other countries.
- **Insight:** The business is highly reliant on the UK market. While this indicates a strong domestic presence, it also highlights a potential risk due to lack of geographical diversification. Exploring international expansion could be a strategy for future growth.

### Top 5 Stocks by Sales

- **Chart Type:** Bar chart.
- **Observation:** The bar chart shows the total sales generated by the top 5 stock codes. Some stock items contribute significantly more to overall sales than others.
- **Insight:** Identifying these top-performing products is crucial for inventory management, marketing campaigns, and understanding customer preferences.

### Customer Churn Distribution

- **Chart Type:** Histogram.
- **Observation:** The histogram displays the distribution of customers based on the number of days since their last purchase (Recency). A vertical red dotted line is placed at 90 days. The distribution shows a concentration of customers with lower recency (recent purchases) and a tail extending towards higher recency values.
- **Insight:** The histogram provides a visual representation of customer activity and potential churn. The concentration of customers with recent purchases is positive. The customers beyond the 90-day mark could be considered at risk of churn, and targeted re-engagement strategies could be implemented for this group.

## Conclusion

The analysis reveals that the online retail business experiences significant seasonal sales fluctuations, with a strong peak in November. The business is heavily dependent on the UK market and a few top-selling stock items. RFM analysis and the churn distribution highlight the importance of customer segmentation and proactive measures to retain customers, particularly those who have not made a purchase recently. These insights provide a foundation for developing data-driven strategies to optimize sales, enhance customer retention, and drive overall business growth.
